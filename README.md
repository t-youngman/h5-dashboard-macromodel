# Dashboard for inspecting h5 output files from INET Oxford macro model
First make sure you have requirements installed
```
streamlit
pandas
h5py
plotly
numpy
```

To run, use
```
streamlit run h5_dashboard.py
```

The app will look for any h5 files in the same directory as the script or in a child directory within the same folder. A dropdown menu allows you to choose which h5 to visualise, if you have more than one. It assumes the structure of the h5 file is the standard output generated by the INET Oxford macro model.
